As you can see, it was super ugly and a huge mess. There were tons of fields that I felt were irrelevant to the analysis that we were going to be doing, so I wrote up a quick python file to munge the raw data. The purpose of the munging was to eliminate the unnecessary fields that was clogging up the file. (A cleaned-up version of the data can be found the `data` file; the code used to munge the data can be found in the `munge.py` file.) Specifically, I wanted to remove the fields that involved description and URLs, partially because they didn't seem necessary and partially because they were the primary issues in terms of readability for me.

For the code, I took inspiration from the structure of the code used to munge our data for the Midterm Exam. I created a function, `remove_unnecessary_fields()`, which iterated through the dictionary created by Python's DictReader and returned only the values corresponding to necessary fields.

The new data looks something like this (which I personally think is much better!):

| id | name | host_name | host_is_superhost | neighbourhood | neighbourhood_cleansed | neighbourhood_group_cleansed | beds | price | review_scores_rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Analysis
<br>

1. `db.listings.find().limit(2);`

This code finds all of the documents in this collection, but only displays two of them, which are in no particular order.

Since there are no particular criteria, though, this also means that there is not as much that is interesting about this "analysis".

The results can be seen below:

```javascript
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60760a8a7c6a86bb05b3a6e9"), "id" : 3781, "name" : "HARBORSIDE-Walk to subway", "host_name" : "Frank", "host_is_superhost" : "f", "neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States", "neighbourhood_cleansed" : "East Boston", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed" : "", "beds" : 0, "price" : "$125.00", "review_scores_rating" : 99 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60760a8a7c6a86bb05b3a6ea"), "id" : 10813, "name" : "Back Bay Apt-blocks to subway, Newbury St, The Pru", "host_name" : "Michelle", "host_is_superhost" : "f", "neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States", "neighbourhood_cleansed" : "Back Bay", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed" : "", "beds" : 1, "price" : "$70.00", "review_scores_rating" : 99 }
```

<br>

2. `db.listings.find().limit(10).pretty();`

This code finds all of the documents in this collection, but displays only ten of them in a format that promotes readability.

Similarly to #1: because they are in no particular order and there are no particular criteria attached to this query, there is not much to say about it.

A shortened version of the results can be seen below:

```javascript
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("60760a8a7c6a86bb05b3a6e9"),
	"id" : 3781,

	"host_name" : "Frank",
	"host_is_superhost" : "f",
	"neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States",
	"neighbourhood_cleansed" : "East Boston",
	"neighbourhood_group_cleansed" : "",
	"beds" : 0,
	"price" : "$125.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 99
}
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("60760a8a7c6a86bb05b3a6ea"),
	"id" : 10813,
	"name" : "Back Bay Apt-blocks to subway, Newbury St, The Pru",
	"host_name" : "Michelle",
	"host_is_superhost" : "f",
	"neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States",
	"neighbourhood_cleansed" : "Back Bay",
	"neighbourhood_group_cleansed" : "",
	"beds" : 1,
	"price" : "$70.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 99
}
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("60760a8a7c6a86bb05b3a6eb"),
	"id" : 10986,
	"name" : "North End (Waterfront area)  CLOSE TO MGH & SUBWAY",
	"host_name" : "Michelle",
	"host_is_superhost" : "f",
	"neighbourhood" : "",
	"neighbourhood_cleansed" : "North End",
	"neighbourhood_group_cleansed" : "",
	"beds" : 1,
	"price" : "$73.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : ""
}
```

<br>

3. 
```javascript
db.listings.find(
	{
		"host_is_superhost":"t",
		$or: [
			{
				"host_name":"Terry"
			},{
				"host_name":"Michelle"
			}
		]
	},
	{
		_id: 0,
		"name": 1,
		"host_name": 1,
		"host_is_superhost": 1,
		"neighbourhood": 1,
		"price": 1
	}
).pretty();
```

This code finds all documents with a value of `t` in the `host_is_superhost` field, as well as either a value of `Terry` or a value of `Michelle` in the `host_name` field. The results have been restricted so that the `_id` field is not displayed, while the `name`, `host_name`, `host_is_superhost`, `neighbourhood`, and `price` fields are. For general readability, I also added the `pretty()` function to the end.

What is interesting to note is that surprisingly, the prices of locations hosted by "superhosts" vary widely, and some can still be pretty cheap. It might influence prices somewhat, but cheaper does not necessarily mean that the hosts are any less welcoming, accomodating, or helpful!

A shortened version of the results can be seen below:

```javascript
{
	"name" : "$99 Special!! Home Away! Condo",
	"host_name" : "Terry",
	"host_is_superhost" : "t",
	"neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States",
	"price" : "$169.00"
}
{
	"name" : "Room in geographical heart of Hub",
	"host_name" : "Michelle",
	"host_is_superhost" : "t",
	"neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States",
	"price" : "$78.00"
}
{
	"name" : "$99* SPECIAL* 2 bed ApT! Location!",
	"host_name" : "Terry",
	"host_is_superhost" : "t",
	"neighbourhood" : "Boston, Massachusetts, United States",
	"price" : "$231.00"
}
```

<br>

4. `db.listings.distinct("host_name");`

This code finds all the unique values within the `host_name` field.

What might be interesting to note is that the hosts do not have to provide their full legal name to potential Airbnb guests, and oftentimes they do not.

A shortened list can be seen below:

```javascript
[
	"A And L",
	"A Delightful Hotel",
	"AAA Homestays",
	"Aanchal",
	"Aaron",
	"Aaron & Catherine",
	"Abdurrahman",
	"Abhishek",
	"Abigail",
	"Acacia"
]
```

<br>

5. 
```javascript
db.listings.find(
	{
		"beds": {
			$gt: 2
		},
		"neighbourhood_group_cleansed": "",
		"review_scores_rating": {
			$ne: ""
		}
	},
	{
		_id: 0,
		"name": 1,
		"beds": 1,
		"review_scores_rating": 1,
		"price": 1
	}
).sort({"review_scores_rating": -1}).pretty();
```

This code finds all documents where the `beds` field has a value of 2 or higher. The `neighbourhood_group_cleansed` fields are blank in my data set, so I didn't specify, but you can imagine that it would be some value such as `Roxbury`, for example. I also tacked on the addition qualification of `review_scores_rating` not being a blank field, partially because there were so many results otherwise, and partially because it didn't make sense to me that if I didn't specify, MongoDB would assume that a blank field is higher in value than a value of 100. Speaking of sorting the results: this code also sorts the results by descending `review_scores_rating`.

It is to be expected, but from the results we can see that higher review scores tend to mean higher prices as well; this makes sense, since people typically do charge more for higher quality experiences.

A shortened version of the results can be seen below:

```javascript
{
	"name" : "3-story Luxury in Central Location",
	"beds" : 3,
	"price" : "$199.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}
{
	"name" : "Family friendly Boston home",
	"beds" : 6,
	"price" : "$400.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}
{
	"name" : "Condo overlooking Boston Harbour",
	"beds" : 3,
	"price" : "$350.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}
```

6. `db.listings.aggregate([{"$group" : { _id: "$host_name", count: { $sum: 1 }}}]).pretty();`

This code finds the number of listings for each host in the data set by grouping documents by the `host_name` field and then counting the number of documents in each corresponding group.

As can be seen, the typical number of listings for each host is one or two; there are rarely more than that, which makes sense because it must be quite rare to own more than that number of spare properties which you can rent out as Airbnbs.

A shortened list of results can be seen below:

```javascript
{ "_id" : "Ting", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Liya", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Noemi", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Abdurrahman", "count" : 2 }
{ "_id" : "Henry", "count" : 2 }
{ "_id" : "Labdhi", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Rahul", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Spenser", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Maude", "count" : 2 }
{ "_id" : "Sada", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Benjamin", "count" : 2 }
{ "_id" : "Franklin", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Selim", "count" : 2 }
{ "_id" : "Eva", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "April", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Heidi", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Cora", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Cheryl", "count" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Boston Strong", "count" : 4 }
{ "_id" : "Tony", "count" : 5 }
```

7. `db.listings.aggregate([{"$group" : { _id: "$neighbourhood", average: { $avg: "$review_scores_rating" }}}, {$match: {"average": { $gt: 95}}}, {$sort: { average: -1 }}]).pretty();`

```javascript
db.listings.aggregate(
	[
		{
			"$group" : {
				_id: "$neighbourhood",
				average: {
					$avg: "$review_scores_rating"
				}
			}
		},
		{
			$match: {
				"average": {
					$gt: 95
				}
			}
		},
		{
			$sort: {
				average: -1
			}
		}
	]
).pretty();
```

This code finds all neighbourhoods in the `neighbourhood` field which has an average review scores rating of 95 or above. Furthermore it sorts the results in descending order based on the averages.

What we can speculate based on the results of this query is that the better an area is, the better the averages of its review scores will be. Thus, Allston, Cambridge, Jamaica Plain, all must be pleasant or relatively wealthy areas. (I grew up near Boston, so I can verify that this is accurate, at least stereotypically speaking.)

The full set of results can be seen below:

```javascript
{ "_id" : "Boston, Allston, Ma, United States", "average" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Boston, , Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Jamaica Plain , Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 99 }
{
	"_id" : "Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, United States",
	"average" : 98
}
{ "_id" : "Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 96.8 }
{ "_id" : "Roslindale, Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 96 }
{ "_id" : "Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 96 }
{ "_id" : "East Boston, Massachusetts, United States", "average" : 95.75 }
```
